# DevOps Practical Test (CI/CD Simulation)

This project is a simple static site used for testing basic DevOps concepts.

## Objective

Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs on every push to `main`
- Prints date
- Runs a dummy test
- Copies `index.html` to a `deploy/` folder (simulated deployment)

## Steps (For Candidate)

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a small change to `index.html` (e.g., change text).
3. Commit and push.
4. Check the Actions tab to confirm workflow ran.
